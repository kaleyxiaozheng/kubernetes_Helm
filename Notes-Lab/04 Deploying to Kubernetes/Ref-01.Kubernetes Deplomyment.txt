Deployments are an important tool if you want to take full advantage of the automation capabilities provided by Kubernetes. In this lesson, we will discuss what deployments are and brieï¬‚y mention some common use cases for Kubernetes deployments. We will also create a simple deployment in our cluster and explore how we can interact with it.Here are the commands used in this lesson:

Create a deployment:

cat <<EOF | kubectl create -f -apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata: 
name: nginx-deployment  
labels: 
app: nginx 
spec: 
replicas: 2  
selector: 
matchLabels: 
app: nginx  
template: 
metadata: 
labels: 
app: nginx  
spec:
containers: 
- name: nginx
image: nginx:1.15.4 
ports:- containerPort: 80
EOF


Get a list of deployments:

kubectl get deployments


Get more information about a deployment:

kubectl describe deployment nginx-deployment


Get a list of pods:

kubectl get pods



You should see two pods created by the deployment.
